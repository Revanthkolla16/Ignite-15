## 🕰️ Migration & Legacy Bug Fixes
This project was originally built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The following improvements were made before migrating to React + Tailwind:

### Bug Fixes (Legacy)
- **Cart Initialization**: Fixed logic to properly initialize the cart from localStorage or as an empty array.
- **LocalStorage Key Consistency**: Standardized the cart key to `cart` throughout the code.
- **Product Detail Rendering**: Corrected element ID usage and ensured product details render correctly.
- **Add to Cart Button**: Fixed event handling and parameter passing for adding products to the cart.
- **Filter Button**: Implemented missing filter logic for product search.
- **Saving to LocalStorage**: Fixed logic to only store the cart array, not a string.
- **Ensured all cart and UI state is robustly persisted and restored.**

### Enhancements (Legacy)
- **UI/UX**:
  - Added a modern cart modal/sidebar for viewing and managing cart items.
  - Improved button styles, layout, and accessibility.
  - Added feedback for cart actions and empty states.
  - Visually separated product details and improved overall layout.
- **Responsiveness**:
  - Added responsive CSS for mobile and tablet devices.
  - Ensured all components adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Code Structure**:
  - Modularized JavaScript into clear sections: product rendering, cart management, event handling, and modal logic.
  - Added comments and improved variable naming for maintainability.
